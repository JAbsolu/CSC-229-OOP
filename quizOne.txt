Prompt

Write a number classification program.

Print a message to the user to enter an integer number.
Read the number the user will input
The program should print out
The factors of the absolute value of the number. This means that if the 
number is -10, print the factors of -10.
In a tabular format, print whether the number is even, negative, and/or if 
it’s absolute value is a prime number.
Notes:

Your program must use a while loop to generate the factors and determine 
whether the number is prime or not.
Format your output exactly as in the sample output.
Assume that the user input is correct. No error checking/error handling is 
required.
Assume that you will never get 0 as input.
You are not required to write comments, but you are encouraged to do so. 
Comments can help us understand your code and give you partial credit, if 
needed.
You can use unequal number of tab characters “\t” on the lines of the 
table you will create to ensure proper alignment.
